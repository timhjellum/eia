                <li><p>After an appreciable increase at the start of the month, world crude oil prices saw only moderate changes during the remainder of January. Overall, the lack of volatility once prices had entered a new range was the result of the interplay between the perception of international markets having sufficient inventories to meet immediate demand, and economic and political turbulence. Political tensions between the West and Iran over recently declared trade sanctions drove the initial jump in level. The sanctions established by the United States, which are in part aimed at Iran's energy industry, are intended to thwart Iran from developing a nuclear weapons program. Positive economic trends in some important national economies also lent some support to the rise in prices, as did growing talk of Nigerian oil workers joining a general strike over the government's repeal of a fuel subsidy. Nigeria also experienced it largest oil spill in thirteen years on December 20 during a loading accident at the offshore ongaoil field. The accident halted production activity through January 1 at the field, which produces 200,000 barrels per day or about 10 percent of the country's oil output. Despite these issues, prices for most key streams were tempered by troubling economic matters during the following weeks. Ongoing problems in the eurozone debt crisis prompted Standard & Poor's to announce and implement credit downgrades for nine eurozone countries (Austria, Cyprus, France, Italy, Malta, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain) in mid-January.
