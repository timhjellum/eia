<h3>New Ethanol and Biodiesel Movements by Rail added to the Petroleum Supply Monthly</h3>
    
<p style="font-size:11px;margin:0px;padding:4px 0px;color:#7d7d7d;">
<strong>Released: April 29, 2016</strong></p>


<dl class="survey"> 

<p>
New historical data for rail movements of biodiesel and ethanol between Petroleum Administration for Defense Districts (PADDs) were made available today with release of <a href="/petroleum/supply/monthly/">Petroleum Supply Monthly</a> (PSM) data for February 2016.  Inter-PADD rail movements of biodiesel and ethanol are now available from interactive tables of Petroleum Navigator beginning with data for January 2011.  Only interactive tables of Petroleum Navigator were updated with new historical data.  PDF tables remained unchanged.
</p>


<p>
Adding inter-PADD movements of biodiesel and ethanol by rail to movements by pipelines, tankers, and barges provides more complete and accurate data on regional supplies of biofuels.  In addition, incorporating biodiesel and ethanol movements into regional volumetric balances improves supply estimates for gasoline and distillate fuel oil.
</p>

<p>
The following are changes to PSM tables.

<ul>
<li>There is a new table 60 "Movements of Crude Oil and Selected Products by Rail Between PAD Districts"</li>
<li>The old table 60 "Movements of Crude Oil by Pipeline, Tanker, Barge, and Rail between PAD Districts" was renumbered to be table 61.</li>
<li>The old Table 61 "Net Movements of Crude Oil and Petroleum Products by Pipeline, Tanker, Barge, and Rail between PAD Districts" was renumbered to table 62.</li>

</ul>
