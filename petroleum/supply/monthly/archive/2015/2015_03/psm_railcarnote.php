<h3>New Crude-By-Rail Data added to the Petroleum Supply Monthly</h3>

<p style="font-size:11px;margin:0px;padding:4px 0px;color:#7d7d7d;">
<strong>Released: March 30, 2015</strong></p>


<dl class="survey"> 


<p>
Starting today with the release of January 2015 data, EIA will include new data on crude oil transported by railroads.
</p>

<p>
The new data will fully integrate EIA's petroleum supply and disposition data with pipeline, tanker, and barge data.  Fully incorporating crude-by-rail movements improves EIA's regional petroleum balances by reducing regional crude oil adjustments (unaccounted for crude oil).
</p>

<p>
Petroleum Supply Monthly tables affected are tables 5-27 and 57.  A new table 60 will show crude oil movements by pipeline, tanker, barge, and rail. The old table 60 will now be table 61.
</p>

<p>
Starting with the March 2015 release of January 2015 data in the Petroleum Supply Monthly and interactive petroleum tables, new movements of crude oil by rail will appear and also be aggregated with movements by pipeline, tanker, and barge. EIA is initiating the new series with monthly data revised to include rail movements of crude oil starting with data from January 2010 through the current reporting month, January 2015.
