<li>Petroleum Supply Annual (PSA) <a href="/petroleum/supply/annual/volume1/">Volume 1</a> and <a href="/petroleum/supply/annual/volume2/">Volume 2</a> with revised data for January-December 2015</li>
<li>Revised petroleum export and product supplied data for June 2016 (see note)</li>

Note:  The initial release of PSM data for June 2016 excluded 1,001 thousand barrels of exports of petroleum products from the 50 states and District of Columbia (PADDs 1-5) to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  These exports were added to data for June 2016 in Petroleum Data Tables and product supplied was recalculated using the revised export quantity.  PSM tables in Portable Document Format (PDF) with data for June 2016 were not updated.
