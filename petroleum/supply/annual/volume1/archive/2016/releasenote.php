<p>
Petroleum Supply Monthly (PSM), Petroleum Supply Annual (PSA), and associated interactive (petroleum navigator) data for the period from January 2007-June 2017 are being re-released today (September 13, 2017) in order to correct errors that were accidentally introduced when we released the data on August 31, 2017.  Errors included missing data, incorrect values, and duplicated data series affecting some or all months of data from January 2007-June 2017.  We apologize for the inconvenience and recommend that users of petroleum supply data re-run queries and otherwise refresh data files that were downloaded from the U.S. Energy Information Administration web site on or after August 31, 2017.

<p>
The following notes relate to new data, revised data, and updated hydrocarbon gas liquids (HGL) product categories that were originally released on August 31, 2017.

<p>
Changes to HGL product groups affect most tables of the Petroleum Supply Monthly and Petroleum Supply Annual beginning with data for January 2010.
</p>

<p>
Data for pentanes plus and total liquefied petroleum gases continue to be available in the current release of data.  Quantities of pentanes plus and total liquefied petroleum gases for 2016 remain as they were in the PSM and have not yet been revised to include PSA revisions.  The 2016 data will be updated to include PSA revisions at a later date.
</p>

<p>

Beginning with data released on August 31, 2017, stocks of ethylene held at bulk terminals were excluded from bulk terminal stocks.  Bulk terminal stocks continue to include barrels of ethane.  This change affected bulk terminal stock quantities from January 2010-May 2017.  Bulk terminal stock quantities prior to January 2010 continue to include barrels of ethylene.  Bulk terminal stocks before January 2010 may be revised to exclude barrels of ethylene at a later date.
