<ul>
<li>corrected petroleum supply adjustment quantities for January-December 2015</li>
<li>corrected total crude oil and petroleum products field production for January-December 2015</li>
<li>corrected tanker and barge movements of crude oil from Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD) 3 to PADD 1 for January 2013-December 2014</li>
<li>corrected commercial (non-Strategic Petroleum Reserve) crude oil stocks to exclude lease stocks beginning with data for January 2005</li>

</ul>

<li><a href="/petroleum/supply/monthly/">Petroleum Supply Monthly (PSM)</a> with data for July 2016</li>
<li>Petroleum Supply Annual (PSA) <a href="/petroleum/supply/annual/volume1/">Volume 1</a> and <a href="/petroleum/supply/annual/volume2/">Volume 2</a> with revised data for January-December 2015</li>
<li>Revised petroleum export and product supplied data for June 2016 (see note)</li>
<li>Revised tanker and barge movements of crude oil from Petroleum Administration for Defense District (PADD 3) to PADD 1 beginning with data for January 2013</li>

Note:  The initial release of PSM data for June 2016 excluded 1,001 thousand barrels of exports of petroleum products from the 50 states and District of Columbia (PADDs 1-5) to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  These exports were added to data for June 2016 in Petroleum Data Tables and product supplied was recalculated using the revised export quantity.  PSM tables in Portable Document Format (PDF) with data for June 2016 were not updated.
