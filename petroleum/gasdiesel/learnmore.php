<p style="margin-left:10px"><strong>What causes fluctuations in motor gasoline prices?</strong><br />
Retail gasoline prices are mainly affected by crude oil prices and the level of gasoline supply relative to demand. Strong and increasing demand for gasoline and other petroleum products in the United States and the rest of the world at times places intense pressure on available supplies. Even when crude oil prices are stable...

<p style="margin-left:10px"><strong>How reliable are the motor gasoline and diesel fuel oil prices? </strong><br />
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) of the mean, a measurement of variability of the mean price, is calculated as the standard error divided by the mean. As a measure of precision reflecting the error due to sampling, it can also be used to construct a confidence interval for the population mean. For example, a mean price of $1.67 and a CV of 0.004 (.4%) indicates at the 95% confidence level that the population mean price has an upper limit of $1.68 ($1.67 + 1.96*0.004*$1.67) and a lower limit of $1.66 ($1.67 - 1.96*0.004*$1.67).
