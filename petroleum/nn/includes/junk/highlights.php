<h1>Highlights for May through August 2016</h1><p>As of August 2016, the monthly data collection included 84 operating densified biomass manufacturers. These
manufacturers have a total capacity of 10.4 million tons per year  and collectively had an equivalent of 1,807
full-time employees.
</p>
<p>From May through August 2016, the monthly respondents purchased 4.2 million tons of raw biomass feedstock,
produced 2.3 million tons of densified biomass fuel product, and sold 2.1 million tons (note: feedstock purchases
do not directly relate to production in the same reporting period). May through August domestic sales were 0.4 million
tons and averaged $159.49 per ton. Exports were 1.6 million tons and averaged $152.96 per ton over the same period.
</p>
<p>This data release includes a new table displaying the average heat, ash, and moisture contents of the densified biomass
fuel products.  On average, compressed bricks and logs have the highest Btu (British thermal unit) content and a
corresponding low ash content. Heating pellets have similar values.  Utility pellets, used primarily in industrial boilers,
have a lower heat content and higher ash content than other densified biomass.

<!-- February highlights -->
<!-- <h1>Highlights for February through April 2016</h1>
<p>As of April 2016, the monthly data collection included 88 operating densified biomass manufacturers.  These manufacturers have a total capacity to produce 11.3 million tons of wood pellets annually and collectively had an equivalent of 2,013 full-time employees.
</p>
<p>From February through April 2016, the monthly respondents purchased 3.0 million tons of raw biomass feedstock, produced 1.6 million tons of densified biomass fuel product, and sold 1.4 million tons (note: feedstock purchases do not directly relate to production in the same reporting period).  February through April domestic sales were 0.2 million tons and averaged $156.08 per ton.  Exports were 1.2 million tons and averaged $149.45 per ton over the same period.
</p>
<!- <p>The East accounted for the largest share of domestic sales for February, March, and April, peaking in April with 51 % of the domestic heating market.  The South continued to dominate the export market sales with utility grade pellets destined primarily for Europe.
</p> -->
<!-- <p>The feedstock category Other Residuals, which consists of bark, logging residues, wood chips, post-consumer wood, merchantable wood, and other, makes up the majority of raw feedstocks.  For the reporting period of February through April, Other Residuals averaged slightly more than 52.1 % of all total feedstocks.  Sawmill Residue averaged 18.1%, with Roundwood Timber and Wood Product Manufacturing at 15.5 % and 14.3 %, respectively.

<!-- January Highlight -->
<!-- <h1>January 2016 Highlights</h1>
<p>In January 2016, EIA conducted the first survey of densified biomass fuel manufacturers.  We  collected data from  119 facilities that manufacture densified biomass fuel.
<ul>
<li>Fourteen of these facilities are planned or under construction and expected to begin operating within one year.</li>
<li>Seventeen of these facilities have capacity of less than 10,000 tons per year.  These facilities are not required to complete EIA's monthly survey.</li>
<li>The remaining facilities (either operating or temporarily not operating) reported their production and sales data for January 2016.</li></ul></p>
<p>Facilities required to report monthly had a total capacity to produce 11.4 million tons of wood pellets annually and collectively had an equivalent of 2,252 full-time employees. For January 2016, they reported purchasing 1.3 million tons of raw biomass feedstock and producing 0.6 million tons of densified biomass fuel product (note:   feedstock purchases do not directly relate to production in the same reporting period).
In January, total sales were 0.5 million tons.  Approximately 31% was sold to the domestic market and 69% was exported.
</p>
<p>Utility-type pellets for industrial use (such as electric power generation) for export were produced almost exclusively in the  South and exported almost exclusively to European markets. Historically, the domestic
heating pellets market was concentrated in the East.  However, in January 2016, the West had the largest share of the domestic market with 41% of total U.S. sales, followed by the East (28%) and the South (31%).  The lower biomass sales to the heating  market in the East were attributed to record-high winter temperatures
(see <a href="https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov" target="_blank">https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov</a> November 2015 through January 2016 climate  summary) as well as lower heating oil prices than in the past.
</p>
<p>NOTE:  The next release will contain several months of data, and in the months following, data will be released as collection and quality measures are completed.

<!-- <p>The cooperation and time of these manufacturers in providing comprehensive and quality data to EIA is much appreciated and makes a valuable and previously unavailable contribution to energy information in the U.S.
</p>
<p><strong>Next Release:</strong> December 2016 plans to release several subsequent months of data. Data for each month in 2016 will be released over
the next several months as collection and quality measures are completed.
