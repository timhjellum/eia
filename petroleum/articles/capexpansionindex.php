<h1>Oil Production Capacity Expansion Costs for the Persian Gulf</h1>
<p class="date">January 1, 1996<br />
</p>
<p>Countries surrounding the Persian Gulf supply 27 percent of
world oil demand and 22 percent of U.S. imports. The Energy
Information Administration&#8482;s <em>International Energy Outlook</em> projects that, by the year 2010, these countries will be asked
to supply 39 percent of the world&#8482;s thirst for oil. U.S. imports
are expected to grow 48 percent over the same time period.
Persian Gulf oil supplies will increase in importance to both
the global and U.S. oil markets. Persian Gulf countries will
need to invest large sums to increase production capacity to
meet the demand.
</p>
<p>Persian Gulf oil development, production, and operating costs
have received the attention of industry analysts in recent
years . Concerns range from the revenue available for the
local economy, to the investment necessary to meet the
expected growth in oil demand. The total cost of the projected
capacity expansion is a relatively small percentage of the gross
revenue. However, oil export revenues provide the vast
majority of government income in the Persian Gulf countries.
Typically, national oil companies have to compete with
defense spending, social programs, and other government
services for investment funds from their governments. Other
options are for the government/company to borrow the
investment funds or allow foreign companies to acquire equity
positions. The advantages and disadvantages of these funding
options vary among the Persian Gulf countries. Before the
year 2010, the Persian Gulf countries will have to develop
between 38 and 251 billion barrels of oil at a cost of 31 to 371
billion dollars to meet the expected demand for Persian Gulf
oil.
</p>
<p>This report attempts to quantify the cost of expanding oil
production capacity using individual geologic plays in the
countries surrounding the Persian Gulf through the year 2010.
The countries included in this report are Iran, Iraq, Kuwait,
Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi, and Dubai
</p>
<p>Petroconsultants' <em>Estimator</em> database and software were used
to define eight geologic plays in formations of Mesozoic and
Tertiary ages, both onshore and offshore. (Data for Saudi
Arabia and Kuwait are not available in this database, but the
surrounding plays are assumed to be representative for these
countries.) Development and operating cost scenarios based
on the three field sizes provided by Estimator for each play
were defined yielding low-, mid-, and high-case values.
Because this analysis is focused on oil, all gas production is
assumed to be flared so that all costs are for oil production
only. (In practice, the flaring of gas has been curtailed and
normally is done only at remote locations.) All costs are in
constant 1994 dollars (no inflation or discounting was used).
</p>
<p>Costs for the eight plays and three field sizes were calculated
and averaged for each of the three cases (low, mid, and high
field sizes) to yield low-, mid-, and high-case cost estimates
for the Persian Gulf area. The following summary table
defines the investment cost in two ways: 1) the cost of
increasing production capacity, 2) the cost of developing
reserves. Also shown are the production operating expense
and a peak daily production yield per developed reserves.

<p>The currently reported remaining oil reserves for the Persian
Gulf countries of Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Abu
Dhabi, and Dubai are about 585 billion barrels (World Oil,
August 1994). Current production is about 19 million barrels
per day (assuming Iraqi production at pre-embargo rates).
This yields an annual reserves-to-production (R/P) ratio of
about 83. A country may more prudently develop its oil
reserves at an R/P ratio near 20. Developing reserves that will
not be produced for many years is economically unwise.
Applying an annual R/P ratio of 20 to the current production
rate yields an estimate of developed reserves of about 140
billion barrels. This leaves about 445 billion barrels of remaining undeveloped (or non-producing) oil reserves for the Persian Gulf area. (In addition, the U.S. Geological Survey estimates undiscovered resources of about 112 billion barrels for these same countries.)
</p>
<p>The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts oilproduction capacity from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates to grow to from about 20 million barrels per day currently to 30.0 to 36.6 million barrels per day in the year 2010 (<em>International EnergyOutlook 1995</em>). Applying the mid-case values from the
summary table above to the projected production capacity
requires additional developed reserves of 54 to 83 billion
barrels at a cost of 34 to 53 billion dollars by the year 2010.
This assumes current capacity can be maintained without
replacing produced reserves from an equal quantity of
undeveloped reserves. The undeveloped reserves determined
above (445 billion barrels) are more than adequate to support
the projected demand. This scenario does not include the
replacement of produced reserves by the development of
undeveloped reserves. Currently, the replacement of produced
reserves is minor, but will grow to significant levels in the
future (exact timing is unknown). (Appendix A contains
tables and graphs that address the replacement of produced
reserves using the same costs as used for adding capacity. If
the replacement of production is included, the comparable
volume of undeveloped reserves to be developed is 194 to 248
billion barrels at a cost of 127 to 161 billion dollars through
2010 (mid-case). The actual costs will likely be somewhere
between those associated with no replacement of produced
reserves and those associated with total replacement of
produced reserves.) </p>
