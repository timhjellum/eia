<h1>Refinery Outages: Description and Potential Impact on Petroleum Product Prices</h1>
<p class="date">March 27, 2007<br />
</p>
<p align="center"><strong>Executive Summary</strong>
</p>
<p>Chairman Jeff Bingaman of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources
requested that EIA conduct a study of the impact that refinery shutdowns have had on the
price of oil and gasoline.1
Up until the mid 1990&#8482;s, the U.S. had excess refinery capacity.
Refinery utilization in 1985 averaged 78 percent, and refinery outages seemed to have
little if any impact on product prices, since a substantial amount of extra capacity existed
to compensate for outages. Between 1985 and 1995, demand grew, while refinery
capacity remained relatively flat, resulting in utilization increasing to 92 percent by 1995.
Since then, U.S. refineries have been running near capacity during the peak-demand
summer months. With little spare refinery capacity available during peak demand times,
unexpected refinery outages can result in local supply disruptions that result in temporary
price surges. Still, refinery outages do not always result in price pressure. Other factors
can influence the impact that outages have, such as the time of year relative to seasonal
demand peaks, availability of imports, availability of inventories, and even what has
transpired in the market place in the prior weeks. The remainder of this summary
provides brief answers to the questions posed in Chairman Bingaman&#8482;s request.
</p>
<p><strong>What is a refinery turnaround, and what activities take place during a turnaround?</strong> There are various types of outages, one of which is the refinery turnaround. A refinery
turnaround is a planned, periodic shutdown of one or more refinery processing units (or
possibly the entire refinery) to perform maintenance, inspection, and repair of equipment
and to replace process materials and equipment that have worn out or broken, in order to
ensure safe and efficient operations. It is analogous to the major maintenance performed
on automobiles, but much more complex. Often, improvements in equipment or the
processing scheme can only be implemented during these turnaround or shutdown
periods.
</p>
<p>Currently, routine turnarounds on key fuel production units are planned for every 3-to-5
years. They may involve 1-2 years of advance planning (sometimes more when major
processing or equipment changes are needed) using dedicated teams from the company as
well as outside contracting and engineering firms. While the objective is to minimize the
time a unit is offline, the turnaround can result in a unit being offline for several weeks to
several months. During a major unit turnaround, as many as 1500-2000 skilled
contractor workers may be brought on site to perform a myriad of interrelated jobs that
require significant coordination and safety measures. Additional personnel vary
depending on the circumstances, but it is not unusual to see staff more than triple during a
turnaround.
</p>
<p><strong>What are planned versus unplanned outages?</strong> Refinery turnarounds are planned, but
they are not the only planned outages. There are less extensive planned shutdowns,
which are planned, targeted shutdowns of smaller scope. These "pit stops"? help to bridge
the gap between planned turnaround intervals, but still require much coordination and  oversight due to the interrelationships among units in a refinery and the complexity and
hazardous nature of the processes involved.
</p>
<p>Unplanned shutdowns also occur. Some unplanned shutdowns do not require immediate
emergency actions, and an affected unit can continue to operate for several weeks,
providing some room for planning, including material and equipment purchases, before
the shutdown. Emergency shutdowns must sometimes be made however. In this case, a
unit or entire refinery must be brought down immediately without warning. For example,
a fire or power outage could create such a shutdown requirement.
</p>
<p>Planned turnarounds and shutdowns can also result in unplanned outage time.
Sometimes when a processing unit is brought down for planned maintenance, other
problems are discovered that may extend the time offline.
</p>
<p><strong>When do outages occur and how are they planned, including information available
on such plans?</strong> Outages occur most frequently in the first quarter and in the fall. These
times are when total U.S. petroleum product and crude oil demands are at their lowest
points seasonally. Within those periods, other factors affect turnaround and shutdown
timing, such as availability of labor, given the very large swings in skilled workers
needed for turnarounds. For example, holidays and hunting season are avoided. Since
adequate skilled workers are not available to handle simultaneous large turnarounds,
contract and engineering firms cannot schedule such activities at the same time. Various
sources of information are available to assist in avoiding clashing projects. The
contractor and engineering firms themselves are important players. Large turnarounds
require enough outside contracting that plans become known even when companies do
not announce them. Private information sources like Industrial Information Resources
publish information on such plans, and the trade press picks up public announcements as
well as information on shutdowns that must be provided to organizations such as the
Texas Commission on Environmental Quality, which requires filings on operational
changes that may result in potential changes in emissions.
</p>
<p><strong>What flexibility do refiners have in changing their outage plans?</strong> The size and
complexity of a refinery turnaround leaves little flexibility to change plans. The large
commitments for labor, equipment, and materials needed for process improvements make
changes very costly at best, and safety concerns can override all other considerations.
Smaller outages may have some flexibility, but even this varies, depending on the reason
for the outage and the associated safety and reliability concerns.
</p>
<p><strong>How much production variation might occur year to year in a given refinery?</strong> Variations in production as a result of outages can be large for individual refineries. EIA
examined individual refinery production from 1999-2005, comparing the highest
production year to the lowest production year for a representative subset of facilities. In
the Gulf Coast region, represented by Petroleum Administration for Defense District
(PADD) 3, for example, the refinery that showed the smallest difference in gasoline
production between its best year with no major outages and worst outage year
experienced an 8.2 percent drop, while the refinery that showed the greatest gasoline
production decline fell 33.0 percent from its best year without major outages. That is, for
PADD 3, assume each of the refineries produced gasoline at 100,000 barrels per day
when not experiencing any outages (Figure ES1). In PADD 3, the refinery showing the
least production impacts from outages only dropped 8.2 percent from its level with no
outages, which, in this illustration, would have reduced its gasoline output to 91,800
barrels per day. However the refinery that experienced the worst loss of gasoline from
outages dropped 33.0 percent, which would bring its production down to 67,000 barrels
per day in this example. The Midwest and East Coast regions did not see quite the same
percentage drops in production with major outages of lower complexity refineries. The
largest drop in the Midwest was about 26 percent from maximum production, and on the
East Coast the largest drop was about 20 percent </p>
<p><strong>How have outages affected production? </strong>EIA data were used to examine the
relationship between input variations that reflected outages and product production on an
individual refinery basis. EIA data do not reflect outages directly, but EIA collects unit
input data that will drop significantly when a unit is out of service. Because units such as
the fluid catalytic crackers (FCC) and alkylation units can account for as much as 50
percent of a refinery&#8482;s gasoline production, an FCC outage can have a large impact on
overall production. However, the impact of shutting down such a unit may be larger than
50 percent of gasoline production. A refinery cannot usually simply shut down one unit
and continue to run the other units at the normal rates. Other units contributing to
gasoline production may also be pulled back. For example, refineries typically have
inadequate storage to hold the material coming from the crude oil distillation tower to the
FCC unit. Even if such storage existed, the FCC unit would not have adequate capacity
to run the stored feedstock later.
</p>
<p><strong>How have outages affected prices?</strong> Within the limitations of the monthly and weekly
data available, EIA&#8482;s statistical analysis of outages indicates that generally there is not a
significant price impact. Prices are affected not by production changes alone, but mainly
by the balance in supply and demand, as represented by inventory levels. If supplies are
abundant relative to demand (e.g., high inventories and off peak time of year), a refinery
outage, even an unplanned outage, is likely to have little impact. The lack of a statistical
relationship between outages and gasoline crack spread may be surprising to some
analysts. Keep in mind, the statistical analyses used are designed to capture normal
market variations and responses, and while they indicate that most of the time, outages
have little impact on prices on a monthly average basis, they do not imply outages never
affect prices.
There are times when the marginal supply of barrels lost due to outages have added to
price pressure, such as when a tight market balance already exists and alternative supply
sources are not readily available. Clearly the outages that occurred during Hurricanes
Rita and Katrina were large enough to impact price. Another case was highlighted in an
earlier report on California gasoline where several large unexpected outages in
conjunction with tight gasoline market conditions seemed to drive up prices. However,
outages with measurable impacts on monthly prices are relatively rare.
