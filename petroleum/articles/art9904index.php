<h1>Demand and Price Outlook for Phase 2 Reformulated Gasoline, 2000</h1>
<p class="date">May 19, 1999<br />
</p>
<p>Congress last enacted major amendments to the Clean Air Act in
1990 (CAA90). The CAA90 (Public Law 101-549) includes
programs to control acid rain and reduce damage to the
stratospheric ozone layer, new standards for emissions of
hazardous air pollutants, and new requirements for motor vehicles
and fuels. The amendments and earlier provisions of the Clean Air
Act appear to have contributed to significant improvements in air
quality nationwide. For example, peak ozone concentrations have
declined 30 percent between 1978 and 1997; the 1997 average
ambient concentration of carbon monoxide is 60 percent lower
than it was in 1978; and annual mean nitrogen dioxide
concentrations have decreased in urban areas by 25 percent since
1978.
</p>
<p>The reformulated motor gasoline (RFG) provisions of CAA90
require reductions in automobile emissions of ozone-forming
volatile organic compounds during the summer high-ozone
season, and of toxic air pollutants and nitrogen oxides during the
entire year in certain areas of the United States. Phase 2 of the
RFG program will begin at refineries on December 1, 1999, and at
retail outlets beginning January 1, 2000.
</p>
<p>This article presents projections of demand and the market price
premium for Phase 2 RFG in the year 2000. The projections in this
article are based on forecasts in the <em>Short-Term Energy Outlook</em>,
which is published monthly by the Energy Information
Administration.
</p>
<p>Demand for Phase 2 RFG is expected to represent about 34 percent
of total motor gasoline demand in 2000. Demand projections are
based on estimated populations of the participating ozone
nonattainment areas and per capita motor gasoline demand in each
area.
</p>
<p>Refineries will have to change operating procedures, make plant
modifications, and obtain new process equipment in order to meet
the new emissions reduction requirements for Phase 2 RFG. The
higher costs of production are expected to yield the following
wholesale price premiums (in cents per gallon of gasoline) for
Phase 2 RFG above the price of conventional motor gasoline:</p>

<p>
These projected price premiums may fluctuate by as much as 1
cent per gallon depending on the market price of oxygenates (e.g.,
fuel ethanol and MTBE).
</p>
<p>Additional costs to store, transport, and distribute RFG are not
expected as Phase 2 RFG works its way through the system
replacing Phase 1 RFG. If the current trend requiring specific
gasolines in limited areas continues, though, local spikes in retail
prices could become more routine.
</p>
<p>The use of oxygenates, which have a lower energy content than the
motor gasoline components they displace, raises consumers&#8482;
effective final costs by 0.5 to 1.5 percent as a result of reduced fuel
economy (i.e., miles per gallon).
