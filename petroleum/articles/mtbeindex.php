<h1>Eliminating MTBE in Gasoline in 2006</h1>
<p class="date"> February 22, 2006<br />
</p>
<p>In 2005, a number of petroleum companies announced their intent to remove methyl
tertiary-butyl ether (MTBE) from their gasoline in 2006. Companies&#8482; decisions to
eliminate MTBE have been driven by State bans due to water contamination concerns,
continuing liability exposure from adding MTBE to gasoline, and perceived potential for
increased liability exposure due to the elimination of the oxygen content requirement for
reformulated gasoline (RFG) included in the Energy Policy Act of 2005. EIA&#8482;s informal
discussions with a number of suppliers indicate that most of the industry is trying to
move away from MTBE before the 2006 summer driving season.
</p>
<p>Currently, the largest use of MTBE is in RFG consumed on the East Coast outside of
New York and Connecticut and in Texas. The other RFG areas in the
Midwest and California have already moved from MTBE to ethanol. Most companies
eliminating MTBE in the short-run will blend ethanol into the gasoline to help replace the
octane and clean-burning properties of MTBE. The rapid switch from MTBE to ethanol
could have several impacts on the market that serve to increase the potential for supply
dislocations and subsequent price volatility on a local basis. These impacts stem mainly
from:
<ul>
<li>Net loss of gasoline production capacity</li><li>Tight ethanol market, limited in the short-run by ethanol-production capacity and
transportation capability to move increased volumes to areas of demand</li><li>Limited resources and permitting issues hampering gasoline suppliers abilities to
quickly get terminal facilities in place to store and blend ethanol</li><li>Loss of import supply sources that cannot deliver MTBE-free product, or that
cannot produce the high-quality blendstock needed to combine with ethanol </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>The different properties between MTBE and ethanol affect not only production, but
distribution and storage of gasoline as well. Ethanol-blended gasoline cannot be
intermingled with other gasolines during the summer months, and ethanol, unlike
MTBE, must be transported and stored separately from the base gasoline mixture to
which it is added until the last step in the distribution chain. Many areas of the
distribution system cannot handle additional products without further investments.
