<h1>California Gasoline Price Study, 2003</h1>
<p class="date">May 1, 2003<br />
</p>
<p>California was scheduled to ban the use of methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline
in January 2003, but a number of factors caused the State to delay the ban for one year to
January 2004. Many California refiners chose to remove MTBE early, however, and at
the beginning of 2003, refiners switched about 45 percent of California gasoline
production (about 500 thousand barrels per day) from the use of MTBE to ethanol. As
refiners began the transition from winter-specification gasoline to the harder-to-produce
summer-specification gasoline using ethanol, the State experienced a price spike. The
coincidence of this winter-summer transition with the spring price spike prompted
Congressman Doug Ose to request that the Energy Information Administration (EIA)
explore whether the switch from MTBE to ethanol caused the price spike and what lay
ahead for the California gasoline market. EIA produced a preliminary report in May
addressing the specific questions asked by Congressman Ose. This is the final report, in
which EIA analyzes the spring price run-up and reviews the California gasoline market
during the rest of summer 2003. Our findings regarding the reasons behind the spring
run-up are unchanged from the preliminary report.
</p>
<p>California uses a reformulated gasoline that meets stricter emission standards than those
for Federal reformulated gasoline (RFG). Prior to 2003, most of the State&#8482;s gasoline
contained MTBE, which was used to diminish the gasoline&#8482;s air emissions and to
improve engine performance. Federal RFG is also required to contain 2 percent by
weight of oxygen. Although California does not have this requirement, some areas in the
State must meet Federal requirements, and MTBE, which contains oxygen, was also used
to meet the Federal oxygen requirement. However, detection of MTBE in some water
supplies caused the State to ban its use in motor fuel by the end of 2003. As MTBE is
eliminated, it is being replaced with ethanol, which, like MTBE, satisfies the Federal
RFG standard for oxygen content, while also supplying needed octane. Major gasoline
specification changes, such as the removal of MTBE and use of ethanol in its place, can
create market dislocations that give rise to price spikes during the transition.
</p>
<p>The spring price surge was quite large. After a period of relative stability for much of
2002, gasoline prices throughout the United States began to rise in December. The
national average retail price for regular gasoline rose 37 cents per gallon between December 9, 2002, and March 17, 2003, reaching what was then an all-time record
(nominal) price of $1.73 per gallon. Over roughly the same period (though beginning
two weeks later), California retail regular gasoline prices rose 63 cents to an all-time high
of $2.15 per gallon. After peaking on March 17, retail gasoline prices fell sharply
through early June, with the U.S. average dropping to $1.47 by June 2, and California
falling to $1.70 by June 9.
</p>
<p>Gasoline price spikes are not unusual in California. Since the mid-1990s, California has
experienced gasoline price run-ups that are more frequent and more severe than price
spikes in most of the rest of the United States. Demand growth has caught up with the
petroleum supply system in California. Refineries, ports, pipelines and distribution
terminals are all experiencing constraints. Many times events, such as refinery outages,
that in the past had little impact can push the system out of balance long enough to trigger
large price increases. Major factors that contribute to higher prices and volatility in
California include:
<ul>
<li>The California refinery system runs near its capacity limits, which means there is
little excess capability in the region to respond to unexpected shortfalls;
</li>
<li>California is isolated and lies a great distance from other supply sources (e.g., 14
days travel by tanker from the Gulf Coast), which prevents a quick resolution to
any supply/demand imbalances; and
</li>
<li>The region uses a unique gasoline that is difficult and expensive to make, and as a
result, the number of other suppliers who can provide product to the State are
limited.
</ul>
</p>
<p>Because short-term supply responses are no longer available to California, when supplydemand
imbalances occur, demand adjustments must play a larger role in returning the
market to equilibrium. Consequently, prices rise higher than in other regions where
quicker supply solutions exist. Gasoline price spikes are not unusual in California.
</p>
<p>Another factor sometimes influences California prices â€“ the Arizona and Nevada
markets. California refiners also supply markets in Nevada and parts of Arizona,
including fast-growing population centers such as Las Vegas and Phoenix. California
prices can, therefore, experience extra upward pressure if these markets attract additional
product from California.
</p>
<p>Following the Spring gasoline price run-up, two other price surges occurred in 2003, one
in June and the other in August. Average California retail gasoline prices rose 11 cents in
2 weeks to peak at $1.81 on June 23, and then took 6 weeks to decline to $1.70 by August
4. Prices began to rise strongly again in August, with the U.S. average retail regular
gasoline price rising 23 cents from July 28 to August 25, peaking at a new record
nominal high of $1.75. California prices climbed 40 cents from August 4 through August
25, but at $2.10 per gallon, fell short of their March record peak. Both U.S. and
California average prices began to decline in September, and by mid-October, had fallen
by 18 and 30 cents, respectively.
</p>
<p>Price spikes occur when supply becomes tight, usually characterized by gasoline
inventories falling rapidly and reaching abnormally low levels. Markets typically tighten
for reasons such as loss of gasoline production from refinery outages, the spring
transition from winter- to summer-specification gasoline, or unusually strong demand
periods that can occur in the summer driving season. In addition, the transition to a new
fuel specification, such as changing from MTBE to ethanol as described below, can cause
upward price pressure.
