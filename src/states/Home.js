				<h1 className="_h1">States</h1>
				<h3 className="_h3">State Rules</h3>
				<p className="_p">
					A state is something that augments and overrides all other styles. For
					example, an accordion section may be in a collapsed or expanded state.
					A message may be in a success or error state.
				</p>
				<p className="_p">
					States are generally applied to the same element as a layout rule or
					applied to the same element as a base module class.
				</p>
				<ExamplePlaceholder />
				<p className="_p">
					The header element just has an ID. As such we can assume that any
					styles, if there are any, on this element are for layout purposes and
					that the <code>is-collapsed</code> represents a collapsed state. One
					might presume that without this state rule, the default is an expanded
					state.
				</p>
				<p className="_p">
					The <code>msg</code> module is simple enough and has an error state
					applied to it. One could imagine a success state could be applied to
					the message, alternatively.
				</p>
				<p className="_p">
					Finally, the field label has a hidden state applied to hide it from
					sight but still keep it for screen readers. In this case, we are
					actually applying the state to a base element and not overriding a
					layout or module.
				</p>
				<h3 className="_h3">Isnʼt it just a module?</h3>
				<p className="_p">
					There is plenty of similarity between a sub-module style and a state
					style. They both modify the existing look of an element. However, they
					differ in two key ways:
				</p>
				<ol>
					<li>State styles can apply to layout and/or module styles; and</li>
					<li>State styles indicate a JavaScript dependency.</li>
				</ol>
				<p className="_p">
					It is this second point that is the most important distinction.
					Sub-module styles are applied to an element at render time and then
					are never changed again. State styles, however, are applied to
					elements to indicate a change in state while the page is still running
					on the client machine.
				</p>
				<p className="_p">
					For example, clicking on a tab will activate that tab. Therefore, an{" "}
					<code>is-active</code> or <code>is-tab-active</code> class is
					appropriate. Clicking on a dialog close button will hide the dialog.
					Therefore, an <code>is-hidden</code> class is appropriate.
				</p>
				<h2 id="tips">Using !important</h2>
				<p className="_p">
					States should be made to stand alone and are usually built of a single
					class selector.
				</p>
				<p className="_p">
					Since the state will likely need to override the style of a more
					complex rule set, the use of <code>!important</code> is allowed and,
					dare I say, recommended. (I used to say that <code>!important</code>{" "}
					was never needed but on complex systems, it is often a necessity.) You
					won’t normally have two states applied to the same module or two
					states that tend to affect the same set of styles, so specificity
					conflicts from using <code>!important</code> should be few and far
					between.
				</p>
				<p className="_p">
					With that said, be cautious. Leave <code>!important</code> off until
					you actually and truly need it (and you will see why in this next
					example). Remember, the use of <code>!important</code> should be
					avoided for all other rule types. Only states should have it.
				</p>
				<h2>Combining State Rules with Modules</h2>
				<p className="_p">
					Inevitably, a state rule will not be able to rely on inheritance to
					apply its style in the right place. Sometimes a state is very specific
					to a particular module where styling is very unique.
				</p>
				<p className="_p">
					In a case where a state rule is made for a specific module, the state
					class name should include the module name in it. The state rule should
					also reside with the module rules and not with the rest of the global
					state rules.
				</p>
				<ExamplePlaceholder />
				<p className="_p">
					If you are doing just-in-time loading of your CSS, generic states
					should be considered part of the base and global styles and loaded on
					initial page load. The styles for a particular module wonʼt need to be
					loaded until that particular module is loaded.
				</p>
