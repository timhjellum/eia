				<p className="_p">Try to avoid conditional styling based on location. If you are changing the look of a module for usage elsewhere on the page or site, sub-class the module instead.</p>

				<p className="_p">To help battle against specificity (and if IE6 isnâ€™t a concern), then you can double up on your class names like in the next example.</p>

				<p className="_p">You may be concerned about this, depending on the order of loading. For example, on Yahoo! Mail, we have code coming from different places. We had our base button styles and then we had a special set of buttons for the compose screen. However, when you clicked to add a contact to your address book, it loaded a component from a different product: Address Book. (Yes, the address book is a different product within Yahoo!.) The address book loaded its own base button styles, thereby overwriting the sub-classed button styles that we had.</p>

				<p className="_p">If load order is a factor in your project, watch out for specificity issues.</p>

				<p className="_p">While more specific layout components assigned with IDs could be used to provide specialized styling for modules, sub-classing the module will allow the module to be moved to other sections of the site more easily and you will avoid increasing the specificity unnecessarily.</p>

				<p className="_p">
					Modules are the reusable and modular components of the page. Modules can be
					<strong>nested</strong> and each Module should be designed to exist as a<strong>standalone component</strong>. In doing so, the page will be more flexible. If done right, Modules can easily be moved to different parts of the layout without breaking.
