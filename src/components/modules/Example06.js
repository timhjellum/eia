					The problem with this approach is that you can run into specificity issues that require adding even more selectors to battle against it or to quickly fall back to using
					<code>!important</code>.

					Expanding on our example pod, we have an input with two different widths. Throughout the site, the input has a label beside it and therefore the field should only be half the width. In the sidebar, however, the field would be too small so we increase it to 100% and have the label on top. All looks well and good. Now, we need to add a new component to our page. It uses most of the same styling as a<code>.pod</code> and so we re-use that class. However, this pod is special and has a constrained width no matter where it is on the site. It is a little different, though, and needs a width of 180px.
