										<h2>New England Energy Dashboard Background&mdash;Description of Sections</h2>
										<p>In January 2019, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)
											introduced the interactive, daily New England Energy Dashboard
											(NED) showing energy market conditions in New England to help
											users examine many key aspects of the New England energy market.
                                                                These key aspects include</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Fuel diversification</li>
											<li>Wholesale price volatility</li>
											<li>Energy delivery dynamics</li>
											<li>Weather&rsquo;s effect on operations</li>
											<li>Electricity prices&rsquo; effect on fuel prices</li>
											<li>Regional and on-site fuel stocks</li>
										</ul>
										<p>NED integrates our view of the energy commodities&mdash;natural gas,
											electricity, and petroleum products&mdash;and factors that can
											influence energy consumption, prices, flows, and energy security
											in New England. The dashboard includes detailed regional information
											on
                                                            </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Temperatures</li>
											<li>Various fuel prices</li>
											<li>Locational marginal prices</li>
											<li>Electric grid status, outages, and available capacity</li>
											<li>Current and projected load</li>
											<li>Liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports</li>
											<li>Electricity generation fuel mix</li>
											<li>Interregional electricity transmission and natural gas flows</li>
											<li>Petroleum product stocks </li>
										</ul>
										<p>Energy delivery infrastructure constraints and outages can have a
											pronounced influence on New England&rsquo;s wholesale energy
											prices, energy flows, and operations. As a result, NED illustrates
											these constraints, including
                                                            </p>
										<ul>
											<li>Nuclear generating capacity availability</li>
											<li>Real-time locational marginal prices by Independent Service Operator
                                                                    New England (ISO-NE) zone and electric interface</li>
											<li>Electricity generation outages and reductions</li>
											<li>A map indicating natural gas pipeline capacity use at key flow
												points
                                                                </li>
										</ul>
										<p>Energy systems in a country as large as the United States must be
											managed regionally because of varying resources, delivery infrastructure,
											and consumption patterns. Extensive discussion of electricity
                                                                reliability as a result of the <em>bomb cyclone</em> event in
		New England during the winter of 2017&ndash;18 within the U.S.
		Department of Energy, and notably at the EIA Energy Conference,
		underscored the interest in and need for a regional energy dashboard.
		NED responds to growing concern about U.S. electricity resilience
                                                                energy management in the winter in New England.</p>
										<p>NED condenses significant timely, contextual information on energy
                                                                use in New England into a dense, web-based product that includes</p>
										<ul>
											<li>An overview</li>
											<li>Views on key elements of the overall energy system including
                                                                    electricity, natural gas, and petroleum </li>
											<li>EIA staff commentary </li>
										</ul>
										<p>NED draws on information that EIA collected and produced or gathered
											automatically from others to provide a picture of energy supply
											and use in New England that is as close to real-time as data
											sources will allow. To support this goal, NED is updated every
											day no later than 10:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time. However,
                                                                some sources of information are updated every five minutes.</p>
										<p>This document provides a guide to the sections of NED, including
											their purpose, the data included, and recommendations for interpretation
											and use. It also includes a detailed list of data sources used
                                                                to produce NED.</p>
										<p>If you have questions about NED or suggestions for future changes,
                                                                contact EIA staff at <a href="mailto:newenglanddashboard@eia.gov">newenglanddashboard@eia.gov</a>.</p>

                                                                is organized into three sections:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>A description of the overview, electricity, natural gas, and
                                                                    petroleum sections of the documentation</li>
											<li>A summary of the sources of information used for NED</li>
											<li>A list of the related links providing additional sources of information
                                                                    about New England market issues and fundamental drivers</li>
										</ul>
										<h2>Overview Section</h2>
										<p>The NED Overview section summarizes many indicators and types of
                                                                visualizations related to New England</p>

											<li>Nuclear availability</li>
										</ul>
										<h3>Key Overview page indicators include:</h3>
										<h4>Today&rsquo;s capacity</h4>
										<p>This indicator shows the generating capacity that ISO-NE expects
											to be available for the current operating day, expressed in megawatts.
											We update this section once a day using an Application Programming
                                                                Interface (API) call to the ISO-NE <em>Morning Report</em>. The
                                                                <em><a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/system-forecast-status/morning-report">Morning Report</a></em> provides ISO-NE&rsquo;s preliminary summary of the expected capacity
		available to reliably meet the peak-hour electricity demand and
		reserve requirements to operate the New England power systems
                                                                . </p>
										<h4>Current grid status</h4>
										<p>ISO-NE informs stakeholders about conditions of the New England regional
											power system by updating the grid status in real-time. EIA accesses
											the current grid status with an API call to ISO-NE data. Under
                                                                typical conditions, ISO-NE reports the grid status as <em>Normal</em>,
		meaning the electricity supply is sufficient to meet expected
		demand plus required operating reserves. However, ISO-NE has
                                                                many other <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/system-forecast-status/current-system-status/alert-descriptions">codes</a> explaining the status of the power system condition, including
                                                                varying circumstances when the status is not normal. </p>
										<h4>Today&rsquo;s forecasted peak demand</h4>
										<p>This indicator reports on the expected peak electric demand for the
											current operating day and the hour of the day that demand will
                                                                occur. These values come from data reported to EIA-930.</p>
										<h4>Current demand</h4>
										<p>This indicator reflects the most current hourly electricity demand
											data for the New England balancing authority that is reported
											to the EIA-930. This data is updated hourly and is typically
											about two hours behind the actual time. The current demand indicator
											will change every hour; as the day progresses, NED users can
											see how current demand compares with the forecasted peak demand
											and available capacity for that day.
                                                            </p>
										<h4>Yesterday&rsquo;s peak demand</h4>
										<p>This indicator reports yesterday&rsquo;s peak electric demand and
											the hour that yesterday&rsquo;s peak demand took place. These
											values come from data reported to theEIA-930. This number provides
                                                                a comparison with the current operating day demand. </p>
										<h4>Historic peak demand</h4>
										<p>
											This indicator shows the historic record demand in ISO-NE for each season. NED automatically changes the peak demand depending
											on whether it is summer or winter. The summer period is assumed to
											be from April 1 through October 31. By contrast, the winter period
											runs from November 1 through March 31. If a new historic record is
											set, NED will automatically transition to a new record indicator,
                                                                depending on the season.</p>

										<h4>Generation outages/reductions</h4>
										<p>Each day ISO-NE reports generator-related outages or reductions affecting
											the New England power grid. ISO-NE posts a new estimate of these
											outages each day. EIA obtains that information from the ISO-NE
                                                                <em>Morning Report</em>. Generation outages/reductions are reported
		in megawatts. ISO-NE does not account for transmission line outages.
                                                            </p>
										<h4>Regional nuclear utilization</h4>
										<p>This indicator shows the regional average availability of nuclear
											generating units in New England. EIA calculates the average by
											adding the megawatts of the available units on a given day and
											dividing that value by total summer or winter generating capacity
											for those units, depending on the season. Summer-weighting applies
											to April through October, and winter-weighting applies to November
											through March. EIA acquires the information each morning from
											the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC). Three nuclear power
											plants were operating in New England as of January 2019: Pilgrim,
											Seabrook, and Yankee. Pilgrim is set to retire during the summer
											of 2019. After it retires, EIA will adjust the nuclear-availability
											calculation to account for this change. Planned nuclear plant
											outages are highly seasonal and cyclical. Nuclear plant operators
											routinely take plants down for maintenance in the spring and
											fall (called shoulder periods) when electric loads tend to be
											lower. Further, most nuclear generating plants require fuel recycling
                                                                every 18â€“24 months, which can affect the <a href="/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37252">availability of nuclear generation</a>.
		The unavailability of nuclear generating units can influence
		locational marginal prices. When nuclear units cannot be dispatched,
		ISO-NE may dispatch units that require more expensive energy
		sources, especially in the winter, which can raise locational
                                                                marginal prices. </p>
										<h4>Today&rsquo;s peak hour interchange</h4>
										<p>In the <em>Morning Report</em>, ISO-NE reports each day on the expected
											level of net electric interchange that will occur during the
											5:00 p.m. hour. This level provides an indicator of how much
											electricity interchange is likely to occur between the ISO-NE
											balancing authority and the NYSIO, Hydro-Quebec, and New Brunswick
											balancing authorities. The values are expressed in megawatts.
											Negative values represent imports, and positive values represent
											exports.
                                                            </p>
										<h4>Net natural gas inflows</h4>
										<p>This indicator shows the estimated level of total daily net natural
											gas inflows into New England for the current operating day. The
											flows account for the total amount of natural gas imported into
											and exported out of New England each day. Because New England
											is not a natural gas-producing region, it relies on natural gas
											deliveries from other North American supply areas. This indicator
											does not include natural gas imports from these liquefied natural
											gas (LNG) regasification facilities: the Everett LNG Facility
											and the Northeast Gateway Deepwater Port. Operations at a third
                                                                facility, the Neptune LNG Deepwater Port, are currently suspended.</p>
										<h4>Algonquin Citygate basis to the Henry Hub</h4>
										<p>This indicator measures the daily natural gas spot price spread between
											the Algonquin Citygate (Boston) price and the Henry Hub price&mdash;the
											nation&rsquo;s primary benchmark location for natural gas price
											formation. The difference in prices between these two trading
											hubs can vary significantly depending on several factors, including:
											seasonality or the time of year, the availability of natural
											gas pipeline capacity in New England, and the disposition of
											storms in the Gulf Coast. High basis at the Algonquin Citygate
											can be a key indicator of weather or outage-related pipeline
											constraints, which in turn, can affect fuel selection for power
                                                                generation, electric reliability, and LNG needs <br /> This high
		basis can require electricity imports and use of natural gas
                                                                peak-shaving(electricity demand response).</p>
										<h4>Spark spread</h4>
										<p>This indicator is a proxy measure for the relative profitability
											or gross margin associated with operating a natural gas combined-cycle
											plant in New England with a standard 7,000 British thermal unit
											heat rate per kilowatthour. To find the heat rate, EIA multiplies
											the spot price of natural gas at the Algonquin Citygate times
											7 and subtracts that value by the spot price of power at Nepool-MA.
											EIA has made no other adjustments for fixed or variable operations
											and maintenance costs or for emissions costs. The difference
											between the on-peak price of power and the heat rate-adjusted
											spot natural gas price is the spark spread. Higher spark spread
											values represent potentially greater profits from generating
											electricity from natural gas combined-cycle plants given the
											market-clearing price of wholesale power and the price of wholesale
											natural gas expressed in dollars per megawatthour. EIA publishes
                                                                spark spreads on its website on trade days on its <em><a href="/todayinenergy/prices.php">Today in Energy price page</a></em>.
		EIA derives the spark spread for New England based on information
                                                                from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.</p>
										<h4>Daily spot prices and weekly and annual price ranges&mdash;by fuel</h4>
										<p>These three visualizations show the price of energy commodities in
											the Northeast region for natural gas, electricity, heating oil,
											and crude oil more broadly. These prices reflect current spot
											prices, the range of prices during the past week, and the range
											of prices for the past year&mdash;or for the most recent 365
											days. These visualizations show the relationships between energy
											commodity prices in New England during similar periods. The charts
											also show how current prices compare with prices during the past
                                                                week and prices during the past year.</p>

										<p>Spot prices are shown for</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Natural gas: Daily spot prices for natural gas at the Algonquin
												Citygate (Boston), Transco Zone 6 NY (New York City), and
												TETCO M3 (Texas Eastern's M3 market zone) reflecting prices
												in Eastern PA, New Jersey, and New York City. Prices are
                                                                    shown in dollars per million British thermal units.</li>
											<li>On-peak electricity: Daily spot bilateral prices for on-peak
												electricity at the Nepool-MA (Central Massachusetts), PJM
												West hub (Mid-Atlantic), and New York Independent System
												Operator Zone J (Manhattan). Prices are shown in dollars
                                                                    per megawatthours. Prices cover only weekday peak hours.</li>
											<li>Crude oil and heating oil: Daily spot prices for crude oil and
												petroleum products with weekly and annual ranges that are
												updated each day. Crude oil prices are shown in dollars per
												barrel, and product prices are shown in dollars per gallon.
                                                                </li>
										</ul>
										<p>The source of information for the natural gas and electricity prices
											is S&amp;P Global Market Intelligences. The oil-related prices

										<h4>Real-time net generation by energy source</h4>
										<p>This visualization is based on an API call to ISO-NE&rsquo;s real-time
											fuel mix information. It shows net generation by energy source
											for the New England system in megawatthours for the most current
											reporting interval. The energy source definitions used in this
											chart are slightly different from those provided by ISO-NE. The
											reported value in the center of the
                                                                <em>donut</em> chart reflects total generation across all fuel
		sources for the most recent interval. The timing of the interval
		updates can vary. ISO-NE&rsquo;s power grid depends on natural
		gas to meet regional electricity needs. However, when natural
		prices spike as a result of various constraints, the relative
		share of natural gas in the dispatch fuel mix can fall in relative
		terms because of the unavailability or price of natural gas compared
		with other energy sources. The source of information for the
                                                                real-time dispatch fuel mix data is ISO-NE.</p>

										<h2>Electricity Section</h2>

										<h4>Current grid status</h4>
										<p>ISO-NE updates the grid status in real time to provide information
											about conditions on the New England regional power system. EIA
											accesses the current grid status with an API call to ISO-NE data.
                                                                Under typical conditions, ISO-NE reports the grid status as <em>Normal</em>,
		meaning the electricity supply is sufficient to meet expected
		demand plus required operating reserves. However, ISO-NE has
                                                                many other <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/system-forecast-status/current-system-status/alert-descriptions">codes</a> explaining the status of the power system condition, including

										<h4>Today&rsquo;s peak load</h4>
										<p>Today&rsquo;s peak load represents the hour when the peak load is
											expected to occur based on data supplied to EIA by the ISO-NE
											Balancing Authority respondent. The hour when the peak load may
											occur can change from day to day, but usually it occurs in the
											early evening. The values for the forecasted peak demand and
                                                                the projected hour comes from data reported to the EIA-930.</p>
										<h4>Available generating capacity in ISONE for current day</h4>
										<p>This indicator shows the generating capacity that ISO-NE expects
											for the current operating day expressed in megawatts. This value
											is updated once a day using an Application Programming Interface
											(API) call to the ISO-NE
                                                                <em>Morning Report</em>. The <em><a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/markets-operations/system-forecast-status/morning-report">Morning Report</a></em> provides ISO-NE&rsquo;s preliminary summary of the expected capacity
		available to meet the peak hour electricity demand and reserve
		requirements to operate the New England power systems reliably.

											of the prices from 7:00 a.m. until11:00 p.m. This price is a
											proxy for the price of electricity in New England. EIA calculates
											this price based on ISO-NE data. This price is available each

										<p>This chart shows the hourly supply and demand of electricity in New
											England. Electricity supplied each hour includes the electricity
											generated within New England and the total electricity imported
											into the region. If net imports are positive, New England is
											supplementing its generation with electricity imports from other
											balancing authorities for that hour. If net imports are negative,
											New England is exporting more electricity than it is importing
											from other balancing authorities, which reduces the amount supplied
											in New England on a net basis for that hour. Although net imports
											are equivalent to net interchange, for this visualization, they
											are referred to as imports to explain the daily electricity supply
											stack in New England. The chart also shows the actual hourly
											demand and the forecasted demand by hour and by day expressed

										<h4>Daily spot price of natural gas at the Algonquin Citygate</h4>
										<p>This line chart shows the spot price of natural gas at the Algonquin
											Citygate expressed in dollars per million British thermal units.
											It displays prices for the current year and previous year. The
											Algonquin Citygate is a commonly referenced benchmark price for
											delivered natural gas in New England. Because it represents a
											delivered commodity price, this price reflects constraints on
                                                                the natural gas system, especially in the winter.</p>

										<h4>New England natural gas infrastructure map</h4>
										<p>New England regional natural gas infrastructure map shows the locations
											of LNG regasification terminals, major natural gas pipelines,
											the Algonquin Citygate trading point, and natural gas constraint
											points. The map shows daily natural gas flows and changes in
											million cubic feet per day. It also shows the utilization percent
											of the natural gas network at locations in New England or adjacent
											market locations that affect the regional availability of natural
                                                                gas supplies.</p>
										<p>OPIS Point Logic is the source of the natural gas flow information.
											Point Logic acquires much of this data by scraping the Informational
											Postings disseminated by interstate natural gas pipeline on their
											electronic bulletin boards. EIA calculates the daily change in
											flow and estimated utilization at each flow point. The utilization
											measure reflects the daily flow divided by a reported or determined
											value and represents the capacity at a given pipeline location.
											If a natural gas pipeline capacity value at given point is unavailable,
                                                                EIA estimates a historic maximum by reviewing daily data trends.</p>
