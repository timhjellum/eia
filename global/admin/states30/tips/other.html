    <h2>Other</h2>
    <h2>Weight</h2>
    <p>A subjective measure of the importance of the content.</p>
    <p><strong>Low</strong> = Includes documentation, source notes, and other background information that get limited interest; content that is out-of-date or derivative and a better source is available.  For example, SEDS content are given low weights since they are estimates that are not considered as good as the source data they are based on.</p>
    <p><strong>Medium</strong> = The default setting; includes most non-summary level data tables and analysis reports.  In general, this applies to web pages below the top 50 in terms of views.</p>
    <p><strong>High</strong> = In general, this applies to the top 50 web pages in terms of views but may also include any data table, article, presentation or other kind of content that is deemed very important and worthy of high visibility.</p>
    <p><strong>Ultra High</strong> = reserved for cases where there is a need to give content the very highest priority and ensure that it always appears on top of relevant search results;  should be used on a very limited basis.</p>
    <h3>Status:</h3>
    <p>Content should be active unless there is a reason why we don't want it to appear in the search results.  Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some SEDS data tables will toggle between status of active and suppressed as they are published during some times of the year and removed from the website at others.</li>
      <li>Content under development or in Beta should be tagged as "suppressed" before going live.</li>
    </ul>
