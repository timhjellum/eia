      <p>The States 3.0 Admin Panel manages the faceted search tool on the "Find" page in the U.S. States section of the web site.   The faceted search tool allows users to quickly find State level information from across the EIA website.</p>
      <p>Content from the website to be included in this search tool must be defined or "tagged" for various characteristics.  Broad classes of characteristics like the energy source, type of activity and area make up the facets.  The most important facets are used as drop-down filters in the States 3.0 faceted search tool.
      <p>The Admin Panel serves several functions in support of the faceted search tool:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Tagging of content to be included in the search tool</li>
        <li>Determining the order or "weighting" of results that are generated from the search tool</li>
        <li>Defining and formatting the items that appear in the search tool drop-down filters. </li>
      </ul>
    <p>While this system can be extended to all content on the web site, for the time being it is limited to State level data as related to States 3.0. </p>

      <p>Use the "<a href="cpr_add.cfm">Add a New CPR</a>" page to tag content.</p>
      <p>A <u>Content Profile Record</u> (CPR) is a set of tags (or major characteristics) that describe a piece of web content.</p>
      <p><strong>Content that should be tagged:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Individual data tables that make up a publication, table browser, or stand-alone page.</li>
        <li>Articles that are stand-alone or parts of a publication.</li>
        <li>Visualizations such as maps, charts, video, etc.</li>
        <li>Presentations</li>
        <li>Documentation (for models, systems)</li>
        <li>Survey forms and instructions. </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong> Content should not be tagged:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li> Publications as a whole.  The components of publications are tagged (e.g., individual data tables, analysis, maps, charts, etc.).  General information about publications is entered into a separate publication screen.</li>
        <li>Old archived versions of recurring products.</li>
        <li>Central (non-product specific) landing pages such as the EIA Home Page, L2 Pages.</li>
        <li>Directory lists such as the pages that make up the data and analysis tabs and archived listings.</li>
