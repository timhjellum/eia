    <h2>Source</h2>
    <p>Select one or more sources for the CPR.  In general, the source will be a collection of related content pages that can be defined as distinct CPRs.  Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Publications where each data table or subject page is a separate CPR.</li>
      <li>Blog-style products such Today in Energy where each day's report is a separate CPR.</li>
      <li>Reference content like Energy in Brief where each article is a separate CPR.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Content that is limited to one primary page of content should be defined as one of the 3 types of self-sourced CPRs.  Examples include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>One-time analysis reports (self-sourced analysis).</li>
      <li>One-time "Fact Sheets" (self-sourced, miscellaneous).</li>
      <li>Stand-alone data tables (self-sourced, miscellaneous).</li>
      <li>Stand-alone maps (self-source, reference).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To add a new source to the drop-down list, go to the Source List & Management screen.</p>
