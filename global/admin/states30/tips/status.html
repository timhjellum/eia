    <h2>Status:</h2>
    <p>Content should be active unless there is a reason why we don't want it to appear in the search results.  Examples:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Some SEDS data tables will toggle between status of active and suppressed as they are published during some times of the year and removed from the website at others.</li>
      <li>Content under development or in Beta should be tagged as "suppressed" before going live.</li>
    </ul>
