    <h2>Release Date</h2>
    <p>Leave this blank for the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The correct release date for the CPR is defined in the source  listed above.  Go to the Source List & Management screen to add/update the release date.</li>
      <li>Content with no official release date.  Examples are typically "evergreen" content such as the Kids Pages, Energy Explained and some definitional pages (e.g., a PADD map).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Add the official release date to the CPR for the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A self-sourced CPR with an official release date.</li>
      <li>The content has a release date that is different from the source.</li>
      <li>The source does not define a release date, for example, when the content is released piecemeal over multiple dates (e.g., latest SEDS data).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the official release date does not give an exact date, use the first day of the month.</p>
