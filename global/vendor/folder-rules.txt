PROPOSED FILE STRUCTURE

global/scripts/eia-global.js
              /vendor   /
      /styles /eia-global.css
              /themes   / 
      /images / 
              /sprites  /
              /vendor   /
              /states   /
              /themes   /

//////////////// SCRIPTS FOLDER ////////////////
//////////////// SCRIPTS FOLDER ////////////////
//////////////// SCRIPTS FOLDER ////////////////

ONLY THE INIT FILES SHOULD EXIST AT THE ROOT LEVEL OF global/scripts/

EVERY INIT FILE, A PRE-PROCESSED JS FILE, SHOULD CONTAIN A TOC / SUMMERY OF THE SCRIPTS WITHIN. FOR EXAMPLE, SOMETHING LIKE THIS:

/* Squirrel.js v1.2.3 - http://squirreljs.com
* requires the global/vendor/Squirrel/jquery.squirrel-1.2.3.min.js ==> global/vendor/squirrel.min.js
* requires the global/styles/vendor/Squirrel/css/squirrel.css ==> assets/styles/modules/_squirrel.less ==> global/styles/eia-styles.css
* requires the global/styles/vendor/Squirrel/images/*.* ==> assets/styles/images/squirrel/*.* ==> global/images/squirrel/*.*
* used to show squirrels videos in the about us section
*/

EACH VENDOR INIT SCRIPT, OR CUSTOM EIA SCRIPT, SHOULD HAVE THEIR OWN PRE-PROCESSED FILE LOCATED IN assets/scripts/modules/_name.js

INIT SCRIPTS SHOULD HAVE A SINGLE LOAD FUNCTION

DO NOT DO THIS:

// Squirrel
$(function(){ 
    /*
    run scripts
    */
});
// Gopher
$(function(){ 
    /*
    run scripts
    */
});
// Prairy Dog
$(function(){ 
    /*
    run scripts
    */
});

INSTEAD DO THIS

$(function(){ 
    // Squirrel
    /*
    run scripts
    */
    // Gopher
    /*
    run scripts
    */
    // Prairy Dog
    /*
    run scripts
    */
});

//////////////// VENDOR FILES ////////////////
//////////////// VENDOR FILES ////////////////
//////////////// VENDOR FILES ////////////////

ALL FILES SHOULD END IN .min.js AND SHOULD BE THE VENDOR MINIFIED VERSIONS

RENAMING THE FILES SHOULDN'T BE NECESSARY BUT THE NAMING CONVENTIONS SHOULD BE: plugin-name.min.js

VENDOR NAMING: VERSIONS SHOULD BE OMITTED FROM THE SCRIPT FILE AND REFERENCED IN THE JS FILE. THE EXCEPTION IS IF TWO VERSIONS OF THE SAME FILE ARE REQUIRED. 

FOR EXAMPLE

jquery.min.js
jquery-ui.min.js

VENDOR FOLDERS, IF APPLICABLE, SHOULD LIVE IN THE VENDOR "FOLDER" AND/OR NODE USING BEST PRACTICES (PREFERRED). FILES WITHIN THE FOLDER SHOULD NOT BE REFERENCED DIRECTLY.
VENDOR IMAGE OR STYLE FOLDERS MUST BE REFERENCED FROM THE global/styles/ OR global/images FOLDER. 
THE STYLES FOLDER CONTAINS A FILE NAMED eie-styles.css WHICH IS A COMPOSITE OF MANY PRE-PROCESSED .LESS FILES LOCATED AT 'assets/styles/modules/_{name}.less'
THE IMAGES FOLDER HAS SUB-FOLDERS THAT PARALLEL THE VENDORS FOLDERS. REMAINING IMAGES SHOULD BE WITHIN THE LAYOUTS, MODULES, STATES AND THEMES FOLDERS. BASE OR GLOBAL IMAGES SHOULD BE AT THE ROOT LEVEL OF THE IMAGES FOLDER. 

EXCEPTION INCLUDE SPRITES

PRE-PROCESSED IMAGES SHOULD LIVE IN THE assets/images/FOLDER
PROCESSED IMAGES SHOULD LIVE IN THE website/global/images/..
