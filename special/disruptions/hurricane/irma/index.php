      <p>We are starting to see an impact on electricity demand for the aggregate of all balancing authorities in Florida. Electricity demand today is trending well below the last four days.  The aggregate forecast demand for Florida is down significantly from the previous Sunday.  Much of this dip in demand and the demand forecast appears to be due to Florida Power and Light – the largest utility in Florida.</p>

      <p>FPL is Florida's largest utility serving most of southern Florida and along its east coast. FPL's actual demand on Saturday is well below the forecast demand in the middle of the day and is also well below the actual demand on the same day in 2015 and 2016.</p>
      <p>The demand forecast for Saturday for the City of Homestead, FL (HST) is about one-half of normal demand for the middle of the day. Actual demand today tracked below the forecast.</p>

      <p>Electricity demand for the City of Homestead, FL (HST) shows some of the first storm-related effects. Homestead is located on the southeast coast of Florida and would be one of the first US cities and balancing authorities to experience the hurricane.  There are indications of evacuation-related reductions in demand on Friday. The actual demand was well below the forecasted demand.</p>
      <p>The 8 am today storm track shows the storm moving up the west coast of Florida, making landfall Sunday afternoon and passing over Tampa.</p>
