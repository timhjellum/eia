       <p><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32932"><strong>Hurricanes Harvey and Irma lead to higher gasoline prices in Florida.</strong></a></p>
      <p>Hurricane Irma significantly disrupted gasoline markets in Florida,   first by prompting increased demand and then by disrupting the supply   chain needed to deliver the fuel. The evacuation of people in   anticipation of Hurricane Irma led to higher demand for transportation   fuels and logistical challenges in supplying fuel to Florida that began   before the hurricane made landfall on September 10, 2017.      </p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32852">Hurricane Harvey caused electric system outages and affected wind generation in Texas</a></strong></p>
      <p>        Hurricane Harvey caused substantial electricity outages, as power plants and transmission infrastructure&mdash;particularly in south Texas and along the Gulf Coast&mdash;were affected by high winds and significant flooding. At its peak, more than 10,000 megawatts (MW) of electricity generating capacity in the <a href="http://www.ercot.com/">Electric Reliability Council of Texas</a> (ERCOT) grid and a substantial number of transmission and distribution lines experienced forced outages. At the same time, relatively cool temperatures across much of Texas also reduced electricity demand.      </p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32852">Hurricane Harvey caused U.S. Gulf Coast refinery runs to drop, gasoline prices to rise</a></strong></p>
      <p>Hurricane Harvey caused substantial disruptions to crude oil and petroleum product supply chains and increased petroleum product prices. For the week ending September 1, 2017, gross inputs to refineries in the U.S. Gulf Coast fell by 3.2 million b/d, or 34%, from the previous week, the largest drop since Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. Weekly refinery utilization in the region fell from 96% to 63%, while other areas of the country remained virtually unchanged.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32792">U.S. average retail gasoline prices increase in wake of Hurricane Harvey</a></strong></p>
      <p>U.S. retail gasoline prices on Monday, September 4, averaged $2.68 per gallon (gal), 28 cents/gal higher than prices a week ago. Supply disruptions and refinery outages caused by Hurricane Harvey continue to affect gasoline supply and prices, particularly along the U.S. East Coast and the Gulf Coast, where gasoline prices are 39 cents/gal and 35 cents/gal higher, respectively, than they were a week ago, before the full effects of the storm were felt.      </p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32752">Hurricane Harvey adds uncertainty to gasoline prices for the upcoming Labor Day weekend</a></strong></p>
      <p>Hurricane Harvey, which first made landfall on August 25, 2017, has created considerable uncertainty for gasoline supply and prices, as the area affected by the hurricane is home to much of the nation's petroleum infrastructure. On August 28, the U.S. average retail gasoline price was $2.40 per gallon (gal), the second-lowest price on the Monday before Labor Day since 2004. However, prices on that date do not yet reflect the full effects of Hurricane Harvey.  </p>

      <p><strong><a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=32652">Hurricane Harvey  headed for area with significant oil, natural gas infrastructure</a></strong></p>
      <p>Hurricane Harvey strengthened to a Category 1 hurricane Thursday afternoon and is currently forecast to make landfall over southeast Texas later today or early Saturday. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) expects Hurricane Harvey to continue to strengthen, becoming a Category 3 hurricane before making landfall, and stall over the state, bringing heavy rainfall, winds, and a significant storm surge to the area. To help analysts assess energy-related potential storm effects, EIA maintains an <a href="http://www.eia.gov/special/disruptions/">energy disruptions map</a> that displays energy infrastructure and real-time storm information.
