<p><strong>Final Report<br />
November 9, 2012 </strong><br />
The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that 28% of gas stations across the New York City metropolitan area do not have gasoline available for sale today, same as yesterday and down from 67% last Friday when EIA began its emergency survey. Despite the improvement since last Friday, the 28% remains a significant problem. Some counties in New Jersey, New York City, and Nassau and Suffolk counties have addressed this issue by imposing license plate allocation of gasoline.  For further information on efforts to provide gasoline supplies to the affected area, please go to the Department of Energy's <a href="http://energy.gov/articles/helping-local-officials-address-fuel-shortages">Helping  Local Officials Address Fuel Shortages</a> page.</p>
<p>Hurricane Sandy struck the U.S. East Coast on Monday, October 29, 2012. As a result of the subsequent disruptions to the supply chain for gasoline, EIA implemented an emergency survey starting on Friday, November 2, 2012, to monitor the vehicle fuel supply conditions in the New York City metropolitan area on a temporary basis. Today's report is the last for this emergency survey.</p>
<p>Today's number includes stations that reported no gasoline available and those assumed closed because EIA could not reach them after numerous attempts. Of the stations sampled, 72% reported gasoline available for sale (same as yesterday), 21% reported no gasoline supplies (same as yesterday), and 7% did not respond to attempts to contact them (same as yesterday).</p>

<p>EIA's estimate of stations without gasoline available for sale is a composite number not designed to reflect the specific experience of more severely affected areas.  For more detailed information on gasoline availability, power outages, shelter and recovery centers, local emergency Twitter feeds, FEMA disaster declared areas and more, please go the  <a href="http://google.org/crisismap/2012-sandy">Google Emergency Map</a> available through the Department of Energy's website.</p>
<p>To develop the emergency survey, EIA used the representative sample of retail stations selling gasoline used in EIA's Form EIA-878, &quot;Motor Gasoline Price Survey&quot;. In the EIA-878 survey sample, the New York City area is defined by the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, NY-NJ-CT Metropolitan Statistical Area (see Map). For further details on the methodology used to create the sample, see  <a href="http://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gas_methodology.cfm">methodology</a>.</p>
     <p>Survey questions included the availability of electricity for operations as well as the availability of gasoline and diesel fuel. EIA was unable to contact some stations. EIA included stations in the nonresponse category as stations without gasoline available for sale. In fact, there could be many reasons EIA was unable to contact these stations, including the stations being closed for lack of power or fuel, the stations being too busy to answer the telephone, and a failure of the telephone system. In reviewing results through the week, EIA improved its ability to interpret the survey information. Today's final report uses only data based on that improved interpretation.</p>
