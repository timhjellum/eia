        <p>Hurricane XXX has weakened considerably, but remains a threat to parts of the Atlantic coastline in the northeastern United States and Canada. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) reported that, as of 2:00 p.m. EDT, September 3, 2010, Hurricane XXX was centered about 290 miles south-southwest of Nantucket, Massachusetts. The storm had sustained winds of 80 miles per hour (Category 1), and was moving north-northeast at approximately 21 miles per hour. Hurricane Earl passed near Cape Hatteras overnight, causing some flooding, road and ferry closures, and power outages, though no casualties or major property damage have yet been reported.          </p>
