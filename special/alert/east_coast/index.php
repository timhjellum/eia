<p class="dat"> Release date: January 22, 2018</p>
<?php /*p>The National Weather Service declared an excessive-heat warning for much of the Mid-Atlantic and northeastern United States, including major electric markets covering Philadelphia, Boston, Washington, D.C., and New York City. This report highlights the wholesale electricity market activity occurring in response to the higher-than-normal electricity demand caused by the heat wave.</p*/ ?>
<p><strong>Market design changes  and winter preparedness actions help Northeast and Mid-Atlantic electricity  markets handle January&rsquo;s bomb cyclone weather event</strong><strong> </strong></p>
<p><img src="images/012220118/chart1.jpg" width="620" height="326" alt="Northeast and Mid-Atlantic daily generation mix chart, Dec 1, 2017 - Jan 20, 2018"/></p><br/>

<p>The intensely  cold bomb cyclone weather event in early January resulted in <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=34412">record levels</a> of U.S. natural gas  demand and elevated wholesale natural gas and power prices around the country.  A constrained natural gas pipeline network led  to a significant increase in oil-fired and dual-fuel generation in New England  and New York and, to a lesser extent, in the Mid-Atlantic.</p>
<p>During the cold weather  spanning the end of December to early January, oil use jumped from almost  nothing to a high of 36% of the daily generation mix on the ISO New England (ISO-NE)  system and 9% on the PJM system covering an extended Mid-Atlantic region. On New  York ISO&rsquo;s (NYISO) system, the output of dual-fuel generators, most of which  are natural gas generators that can switch to oil, and other fossil fuel  generators rose significantly.  Coal  generation also increased substantially in PJM.</p>
<p>Day-ahead daily average  peak-period power prices for January 5, 2018, one of the coldest days of the weather  event, reached $247 per megawatthour (MWh) in New England and New York and $262/MWh  in the Mid-Atlantic, compared with $30-$50/MWh average prices in the preceding six  weeks.  These prices were far lower than  the $440-$680/MWh peaks seen during the polar vortex event in January 2014  despite natural gas prices that spiked higher this year than in 2014.</p>
<p>Day-ahead natural  gas spot prices for January 5, 2018, reached $83.75 per million British thermal  units (MMBtu) in New England, $140.25/MMBtu in New York, and $96.07/MMBtu in  the Mid-Atlantic, compared with $3-$5/MMbtu average prices in the preceding six  weeks.  These prices exceeded January  2014 polar vortex prices by about $4-20/MMBtu.</p>
<p>Power markets in  the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic have become more reliant on natural gas over the  past several years following the retirement of electricity generators using  fuels other than natural gas. However, the relative moderation in power price  spikes during this year&rsquo;s cold snap—despite higher natural gas prices—reflects a  host of market rule changes and winter preparedness actions taken by the  region&rsquo;s grid operators to improve winter reliability.</p>

<p>In New England,  retirements of the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=19811">Vermont Yankee</a> nuclear plant, the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/data/browser/#/plant/1619?freq=M&amp;start=200101&amp;end=201710&amp;ctype=linechart&amp;ltype=pin&amp;tab=generation&amp;columnchart=ELEC.PLANT.GEN.1619-ALL-ALL.M&amp;linechart=~ELEC.PLANT.GEN.1619-BIT-ALL.M~ELEC.PLANT.GEN.1619-DFO-ALL.M~ELEC.PLANT.GEN.1619-NG-ALL.M~ELEC.PLANT.GEN.1619-RFO-ALL.M">Brayton Point</a> coal plant, and the <a href="https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/data/browser/#/plant/1626?freq=M&amp;start=200101&amp;end=201710&amp;ctype=linechart&amp;ltype=pin&amp;tab=generation&amp;columnchart=ELEC.PLANT.GEN.1626-ALL-ALL.M&amp;linechart=~ELEC.PLANT.GEN.1626-BIT-ALL.M~ELEC.PLANT.GEN.1626-DFO-ALL.M~ELEC.PLANT.GEN.1626-RFO-ALL.M&amp;maptype=0&amp;pin=">Salem Harbor</a> coal- and oil-fired  plant (which is currently being converted to natural gas), as well as <a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=29032">incremental expansions</a> of the natural gas  pipeline network, have led the region to become more reliant on natural gas  over the past couple years.</p>
<p>During the 12-day  span from December 28, 2017, to January 8, 2018, oil and coal made up on  average 29% and 6%, respectively, of ISO-NE&rsquo;s generation mix. Natural gas  dropped at one point to a low of 17% of generation. One of the region&rsquo;s three  nuclear plants, <a href="https://www.eia.gov/beta/electricity/data/browser/#/plant/1590/?freq=M&amp;pin=">Pilgrim</a>, experienced an  unexpected outage for six days during that period. Dual-fuel reporting changes  in late 2014 make direct comparisons to the polar vortex (2013-14) generation  mix difficult, but oil provided similar contributions during the 2014-15 winter  for shorter stretches of time.</p>
<p><img src="images/012220118/chart5.jpg" width="620" height="326" alt="Northeast and Mid-Atlantic daily generation mix chart, Dec 1, 2017 - Jan 20, 2018"/></p>
<p>ISO-NE&rsquo;s <a href="http://isonewswire.com/updates/2017/10/27/update-on-the-20172018-winter-reliability-program.html">Winter Reliability  Program</a>, implemented  after the polar vortex, has incentivized generators to procure adequate onsite  fuel supplies for winter and spurred 1,774 MW of natural gas-fired generators  to add dual-fuel capability, which allows them to switch fuels or co-fire  multiple fuels simultaneously.  More than  one-third of New England&rsquo;s natural gas capacity has dual-fuel capability with  oil as their secondary source, while about 40% of oil capacity can switch to  natural gas, and about 50% of coal capacity can switch mainly to oil.</p>
<p><img src="images/012220118/chart6.jpg" width="620" height="318" alt="Northeast and Mid-Atlantic daily generation mix chart, Dec 1, 2017 - Jan 20, 2018"/></p>
<p>ISO-NE has also  made <a href="http://isonewswire.com/updates/2014/12/18/energy-market-offer-flexibility-project-explained-qa-with-va.html">market design changes</a> to improve winter  reliability, including allowing generators to submit and update supply offers  for each hour of the day as opposed to a single supply offer for an entire  day.  Dual-fuel generators can now  specify the percentage of fuels they plan to use and the costs for each  fuel.  These changes allow generators to  offer their resources into the market with more accurate representations of  their operating costs.</p>
<p>Other parts of  ISO-NE&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.iso-ne.com/static-assets/documents/2017/11/20171101-winter-generation-readiness.pdf">winter preparedness  initiative</a> include  adjusting the daily timeline of their day-ahead market clearing process to  better align with day-ahead natural gas procurement timelines, requiring dual-fuel  testing, and increasing real-time communication with natural gas pipeline  operators and generators about the status of fuel supplies and potential outages.</p>
<p><strong>New York</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/012220118/chart7.jpg" width="620" height="326" alt="Northeast and Mid-Atlantic daily generation mix chart, Dec 1, 2017 - Jan 20, 2018"/></p>
<p>During the 12-day  period from December 28 to January 8, dual-fuel generators burning oil and  natural gas accounted for, on average, 30% of NYISO&rsquo;s generation mix, while  coal and oil-only generators together averaged 5%.  The breakout by fuel for dual-fuel generators  is not currently reported.  Nuclear  generators provided roughly 30% while natural gas&#8211;only and renewables provided the  remaining 35%.<br />
  </p>
<p><img src="images/012220118/chart8.jpg" width="620" height="326" alt="Northeast and Mid-Atlantic daily generation mix chart, Dec 1, 2017 - Jan 20, 2018"/></p>
<p>In New York,  natural gas makes up more than half of the state&rsquo;s total generating capacity  with about 70% of natural gas capacity able to switch to oil.  About 20% of oil capacity can switch to  natural gas and 13% of coal capacity can switch to oil or natural gas.</p>
<p><img src="images/012220118/chart9.jpg" width="620" height="326" alt="Northeast and Mid-Atlantic daily generation mix chart, Dec 1, 2017 - Jan 20, 2018"/></p>
<p>NYISO has taken <a href="http://www3.dps.ny.gov/W/PSCWeb.nsf/a8333dcc1f8dfec0852579bf005600b1/2654334b210cff95852579e4005f837d/$FILE/NYS%20PSC%2010.15.15%20Session%20Winter%20Preparedness%20Presentation.pdf">actions similar</a> to ISO-NE to improve  winter reliability.  The grid operator increased  generator fuel surveys and site visits, made use of generators with  higher-priced offers when units committed in the day-ahead market could not run,  and developed a streamlined process with New York state agencies for generators  to request temporary emission waivers if needed for reliability.</p>
<p>NYISO made  several market design changes including increasing the system&rsquo;s total operating  reserve requirement from 1,965 MW to 2,620 MW and implementing new pricing  methodologies that allow energy and ancillary service prices to rise higher to more  accurately reflect costs for maintaining reliability, especially during reduced  supply periods.</p>
<p><strong>PJM</strong></p>
<p><img src="images/012220118/chart10.jpg" width="620" height="326" alt="Northeast and Mid-Atlantic daily generation mix chart, Dec 1, 2017 - Jan 20, 2018"/></p>
<p>PJM is a much larger  system that relies on natural gas to a lesser extent than ISO-NE and NYISO.  Oil generation peaked at 9% of the generation  mix on January 7 and averaged 4% during the 12-day period from December 28 to  January 8.  Coal generation, which  hovered around 30% of the generation mix beforehand, grew to about 40% during  the same time period. </p>
<p><img src="images/012220118/chart11.jpg" width="620" height="326" alt="Northeast and Mid-Atlantic daily generation mix chart, Dec 1, 2017 - Jan 20, 2018"/></p>
<p>About 40% of  PJM&rsquo;s natural gas generators can switch, mainly to oil, while 15% of coal  capacity can switch to natural gas or oil, and 4% of oil capacity can switch  mainly to natural gas.  </p>
<p><img src="images/012220118/chart12.jpg" width="620" height="326" alt="Northeast and Mid-Atlantic daily generation mix chart, Dec 1, 2017 - Jan 20, 2018"/></p>
<p>PJM has improved  its <a href="https://www.pjm.com/-/media/about-pjm/newsroom/2017-releases/20171129-winter-readiness-release.ashx">winter readiness</a> by conducting fuel  inventory surveys, cold weather exercises, emergency drills, generator testing  and training, and increasing communication with natural gas pipeline operators  and generators.</p>
<p>Prompted by the <a href="https://www.pjm.com/~/media/library/reports-notices/weather-related/20140509-analysis-of-operational-events-and-market-impacts-during-the-jan-2014-cold-weather-events.ashx">unprecedented amount</a> of generator and  equipment outages during the January 2014 polar vortex, PJM has gradually  transitioned over the past couple years to new capacity market rules under its <a href="http://www.pjm.com/-/media/library/reports-notices/capacity-performance/20150720-capacity-performance-at-a-glance.ashx?la=en">Capacity Performance</a> proposal that increase  capacity payments to generators while also imposing strict penalties for not  performing when called upon by the grid operator during emergency events.  These changes are intended to incentivize  generators to invest in equipment maintenance and adequate fuel supplies to  reduce generator non-performance.</p>
