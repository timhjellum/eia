                  <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/eia1_katrina.html">MOST RECENT</a>--</p>
                <p>According to the <a href="http://www.mms.gov">Minerals Management 
                  Service</a> (MMS), as of 11:30 Central Time September 1, Gulf 
                  of Mexico oil production was reduced by over 1.356 million barrels 
                  per day as a result of Hurricane Katrina, equivalent to 90.43 
                  percent of daily Gulf of Mexico oil production (which is 1.5 
                  million barrels per day). The MMS also reported that 7.866 billion 
                  cubic feet per day of natural gas production was shut in, equivalent 
                  to 78.66 percent of daily Gulf of Mexico natural gas production 
                  (which is 10 billion cubic feet per day).</p>
                <p>There have been many reports in the media of gas stations in 
                  various parts of the country that are out of gas. While EIA 
                  does not monitor supplies at individual stations or localities, 
                  there are some reasons why this may be occurring at selective 
                  stations. With about 2 million barrels per day of refining capacity 
                  shut in or reduced due to Hurricane Katrina, approximately 1 
                  million barrels per day (42 million gallons per day) of gasoline 
                  is not being produced. This represents about 10 percent of the 
                  nation's consumption, and is a major drop in the normal flow 
                  of gasoline through the system. In addition, major pipelines 
                  originating in the Gulf of Mexico area (namely the Plantation 
                  and Colonial product pipelines and the Capline crude oil pipeline) 
                  have been severely impacted or are closed. As a result, the 
                  distribution of gasoline, particularly in the Gulf Coast, Midwest, 
                  and East Coast regions of the country, has been significantly 
                  affected. Localities that were being served from gasoline terminals 
                  which already had low inventory levels, perhaps because they 
                  were expecting a delivery in the near future, could run out 
                  of supply before the next delivery arrives. Other areas which 
                  did have plenty of inventories on hand prior to the loss of 
                  the refineries and pipelines will be able to withstand the loss 
                  of supply for a longer time. However, it is impossible for EIA 
                  to know which terminals were well supplied and which ones were 
                  not prior to Hurricane Katrina, since EIA does not collect inventory 
                  data for individual terminals. But as soon as these stations 
                  are able to receive additional gasoline, they should be able 
                  to re-open.<br>

                  <b>Petroleum</b><br>
                  <br>
                  As of August 26, (<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/weekly_petroleum_status_report/wpsr.html">the 
                  most recent data available</a>), U.S. commercial crude oil inventories 
                  (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) decreased 
                  by 1.5 million barrels from the previous week. At 321.4 million 
                  barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are well above the upper 
                  end of the average range for this time of year. Total motor 
                  gasoline inventories declined by 0.5 million barrels last week, 
                  putting them near the bottom end of the average range. Distillate 
                  fuel inventories increased by 2.7 million barrels last week, 
                  and are above the upper end of the average range for this time 
                  of year. Total commercial petroleum inventories rose by 2.4 
                  million barrels last week and now stand above the upper end 
                  of the average range for this time of year. Total product supplied 
                  over the last 4-week period has averaged 21.5 million barrels 
                  per day, or 2.3 percent more than averaged over the same period 
                  last year.</p>
                <p><i>Impact on Refineries.</i> Unlike 2004's Hurricane Ivan, 
                  which affected oil production facilities and had a lasting impact 
                  on crude oil production in the Gulf of Mexico, it appears that 
                  Hurricane Katrina may have a more lasting impact on refinery 
                  production and the distribution system. However, that news is 
                  varied, with some refineries likely able to restart their operations 
                  within the next 1-to-2 weeks, while others will likely be down 
                  for a more extended period, possibly several months in length. 
                  There are several factors currently inhibiting refinery production 
                  (see EIA's <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/twip/twip.asp">This 
                  Week in Petroleum</a>).</p>
                <p>The U.S. distillate surplus that built up over the last several 
                  months will certainly be important as seasonal emphasis shifts 
                  to heating oil. While distillate prices will react to crude 
                  price and related developments, the more critical near-term 
                  product problem relates to gasoline. </p>
                <p><b>Ports and Pipelines</b></p>
                <p>On Thursday, September 1, it was expected that the Louisiana 
                  Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) might unload its first tanker cargo 
                  since August 27. A pipeline controlled by the port meets the 
                  Capline pipeline system in St. James, Louisiana, which connects 
                  to refineries. The port had already started making deliveries 
                  to Exxon Mobil Corp.'s Baton Rouge refinery from storage. </p>
                <p>According to the director of Port Fourchon (located in Louisiana), 
                  the port is hoping to get its inland waterway system open Thursday 
                  evening, which would help support the oil and gas facilities 
                  in the region. The port had already re-established offshore 
                  access on Wednesday. Once the port is fully open, equipment 
                  and other supplies will be able to get to oil and gas platforms 
                  in the Gulf of Mexico.</p>
                <p>On Thursday, the Department of Energy announced an agreement 
                  to loan 3 million barrels of sweet crude oil and 3 million barrels 
                  of sour crude oil to ExxonMobil from the Strategic Petroleum 
                  Reserve. The Department of Energy also stated that they are 
                  in the process of reviewing other loan requests.</p>
                <p>As of September 1, Capline (a major crude oil production that 
                  runs from the Gulf Coast to Midwest refineries) had returned 
                  to service, though at a reduced rate. Two major product pipelines 
                  from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast, Plantation and Colonial, 
                  are also running, though at reduced capacity. </p>
                <p><b>Natural Gas </b></p>
                <p>As of the close of trading on Thursday, September 1, the natural 
                  gas futures price for October delivery was up 29 cents, to reach 
                  $11.76 per million Btu, an all-time high (unadjusted for inflation). 
                  In trading on the Intercontinental Exchange, the Henry Hub spot 
                  price was $11.36 per MMBtu, down $1.334 from yesterday (Wednesday) 
                  but still up about $1.50 per MMBtu from last Friday's price 
                  (before the storm). At market locations across the Gulf region, 
                  price decreases today ranged up to $1.86 per MMBtu with an average 
                  of $1.30 per MMBtu. The overall average change in price was 
                  $1.05 per MMBtu.</p>
                <p>There are reports that Hurricane Katrina may have damaged four 
                  natural gas processing facilities on the Gulf Coast with a combined 
                  capacity of 5.5 Bcf per day, which is the equivalent of almost 
                  10 percent of total national production. Follow-up reports have 
                  not indicated expected outages longer than a few weeks, with 
                  many units expected on line within a few days. A full assessment 
                  of some facilities, however, will require onsite inspections. 
                  If these or other plants are inoperable for any length of time, 
                  the loss could delay a recovery of natural gas production in 
                  the area. Even if platforms and pipelines are either unaffected 
                  or readily restored to service, the gas often can't flow to 
                  market without treatment. In 2003 (the latest year with complete 
                  data), almost three-fourths of total U.S. marketed gas production 
                  was processed prior to delivery to market.
