                  RECENT</a>--</p>
                <p>According to the <a href="http://www.mms.gov">Minerals Management 
                  Service</a> (MMS), as of 11:30 Central Time September 2, Gulf 
                  of Mexico oil production was reduced by over 1.328 million barrels 
                  per day as a result of Hurricane Katrina, equivalent to 88.53 
                  percent of daily Gulf of Mexico oil production (which is 1.5 
                  million barrels per day). The MMS also reported that 7.248 billion 
                  cubic feet per day of natural gas production was shut in, equivalent 
                  to 72.48 percent of daily Gulf of Mexico natural gas production 
                  (which is 10 billion cubic feet per day).</p>
                <p>On Friday, September 2, the <a href="http://www.iea.org/presseppd.pdf">International 
                  Energy Agency</a> (IEA) directed its member nations to make 
                  an extra 2 million barrels of oil per day available to the market 
                  for the next 30 days, with half of this contribution to come 
                  from United States' Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). A large 
                  portion of the oil from outside of the United States will be 
                  released in the form of refined products. The United States 
                  will put up 30 million barrels of crude oil for sale from its 
                  Strategic Petroleum Reserve, with the proviso that the bids 
                  meet minimum acceptable levels. This oil is in addition to the 
                  9.1 million barrels of oil that will be loaned out from the 
                  SPR to ExxonMobil, Valero, Placid, and ATI, with negotiations 
                  underway for additional loans as announced by the Secretary 
                  of Energy on September 1. </p>
                <p><b>Petroleum</b></p>
                <p>Crude oil prices and petroleum product futures and spot prices 
                  have dropped dramatically on Friday, September 2, due to news 
                  about the release of strategic inventories from the International 
                  Energy Agency and news about improvements in petroleum infrastructure, 
                  particularly for the Plantation and Colonial pipelines. As of 
                  the close of trading on Friday, the gasoline near-month futures 
                  price plummeted by 22.5 cents per gallon from yesterday, settling 
                  at 218.4 cents per gallon, while the heating oil near-month 
                  futures price declined 10.7 cents per gallon, settling at 209.11 
                  cents per gallon. The NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude 
                  oil futures price dropped $1.90 per barrel from yesterday, settling 
                  at $67.57.</p>
                <p>As of August 26, (<a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/oil_gas/petroleum/data_publications/weekly_petroleum_status_report/wpsr.html">the 
                  most recent data available</a>), U.S. commercial crude oil inventories 
                  (excluding those in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve) decreased 
                  by 1.5 million barrels from the previous week. At 321.4 million 
                  barrels, U.S. crude oil inventories are well above the upper 
                  end of the average range for this time of year. Total motor 
                  gasoline inventories declined by 0.5 million barrels last week, 
                  putting them near the bottom end of the average range. Distillate 
                  fuel inventories increased by 2.7 million barrels last week, 
                  and are above the upper end of the average range for this time 
                  of year. Total commercial petroleum inventories rose by 2.4 
                  million barrels last week and now stand above the upper end 
                  of the average range for this time of year. Total product supplied 
                  over the last 4-week period has averaged 21.5 million barrels 
                  per day, or 2.3 percent more than averaged over the same period 
                  last year.</p>
                <p>Electrical power has been restored to some of the refineries 
                  that were affected by Hurricane Katrina, and some other refineries 
                  are expected to have power restored within the next 7-10 days. 
                  This should allow some refineries to begin start producing again 
                  in the near future, but other refineries that were damaged more 
                  extensively from the hurricane may be down for some time to 
                  come. Several factors that may affect refinery production are 
                  highlighted in EIA's <a href="http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/oog/info/twip/twip.asp">This 
                  Week in Petroleum</a>.</p>
                <p>The U.S. distillate surplus that built up over the last several 
                  months will certainly be important as seasonal emphasis shifts 
                  to heating oil. While distillate prices will react to crude 
                  price and related developments, the more critical near-term 
                  product problem relates to gasoline. </p>
                <p>There continue to be reports in the media of gas stations in 
                  various parts of the country that are out of gas. While EIA 
                  does not monitor supplies at individual stations or localities, 
                  there are some reasons why this may be occurring at selected 
                  stations. With about 2 million barrels per day of crude oil 
                  refining capacity shut in or reduced due to Hurricane Katrina, 
                  approximately 1 million barrels per day (42 million gallons 
                  per day) of gasoline is not being produced. This represents 
                  about 10 percent of the nation's consumption, and is a major 
                  drop in the normal flow of gasoline through the system. In addition, 
                  major pipelines originating in the Gulf of Mexico area (namely 
                  the Plantation and Colonial product pipelines and the Capline 
                  crude oil pipeline) were initially shut down but have since 
                  been restarted, although at reduced volumes. As a result, the 
                  distribution of gasoline, particularly in the Gulf Coast, Midwest, 
                  and East Coast regions of the country, has now been significantly 
                  affected. Localities that were being served from gasoline terminals 
                  which already had low inventory levels, perhaps because they 
                  were expecting a delivery in the near future, could run out 
                  of supply before the next delivery arrives. Other areas that 
                  did have plenty of inventories on hand prior to the loss of 
                  the refineries and pipelines will be able to withstand the loss 
                  of supply for a longer time. However, it is impossible for EIA 
                  to know which terminals were well supplied and which ones were 
                  not prior to Hurricane Katrina, since EIA does not collect inventory 
                  data for individual terminals. But as soon as the affected service 
                  stations are able to receive additional gasoline, they should 
                  be able to re-open</p>
                <p><b>Ports and Pipelines</b></p>
                <p>On Friday, September 2, the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) 
                  was operating again, although at less than full capacity. A 
                  pipeline controlled by the port meets the Capline pipeline system 
                  in St. James, Louisiana, which connects to refineries. More 
                  than 10 percent of the nation's imported crude oil typically 
                  enters at the LOOP. </p>
                <p>As of September 1, Capline (a major crude oil pipeline that 
                  runs from the Gulf Coast to Midwest refineries) had returned 
                  to service, with flows at 70 percent of capacity. Two major 
                  product pipelines from the Gulf Coast to the East Coast, Plantation 
                  and Colonial, dramatically improved their flow rates as of September 
                  2, with Plantation running at 95 percent of capacity and Colonial 
                  pipeline at 66 percent of capacity. Colonial pipeline was expected 
                  to be above 80 percent capacity by sometime this coming weekend.</p>
                <p><b>Natural Gas </b></p>
                <p>As of the close of trading on Friday, September 2, the natural 
                  gas futures price for October delivery was down nearly 7 cents, 
                  to reach $11.69 per million Btu. In trading on the Intercontinental 
                  Exchange, the Henry Hub spot price was $11.75 per MMBtu, up 
                  $0.386 from yesterday (Thursday) and about $1.88 per MMBtu from 
                  last Friday's price (before the storm). At market locations 
                  across the Gulf region, price decreases today ranged up to $0.44 
                  per MMBtu with an average of $0.27 per MMBtu. The overall average 
                  change in price was $0.14 per MMBtu.</p>
                <p>There are reports that Hurricane Katrina may have damaged four 
                  natural gas processing facilities on the Gulf Coast with a combined 
                  capacity of 5.5 Bcf per day, which is the equivalent of almost 
                  10 percent of total national production. Follow-up reports have 
                  not indicated expected outages of more than a few weeks, with 
                  many units expected on line within a few days. A full assessment 
                  of some facilities, however, will require onsite inspections. 
                  If these or other plants are inoperable for any length of time, 
                  the loss could delay a recovery of natural gas production in 
                  the area. Even if platforms and pipelines are either unaffected 
                  or readily restored to service, the gas often can't flow to 
                  market without treatment. In 2003 (the latest year with complete 
                  data), almost three-fourths of total U.S. marketed gas production 
                  was processed prior to delivery to market. <br>
